## Basics

### Heading 3

# Heading 1

Inline text I like to __ramble__ about `R` \

**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments** \

*Nature*

Please see our latest methods [link](#methods-section).

## Data and Methods {#methods-section}

We have used a very fancy AI model. 

## Software

All our resources are available here:

I like to reference myself [^1]

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
setwd("~/soumya_cam_mac/teaching/intro_to_R/introduction_to_R")
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
