# NOTE:
# CONCEPT: Anything you put in the ggplot() function can be seen by any geom layers that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings).
# You can also specify mappings for a given geom independently of the mappings defined globally in the ggplot() function.
# The + sign used to add new layers must be placed at the end of the line containing the previous layer. If, instead, the + sign is added at the beginning of the line containing the new layer, >ggplot2 will not add the new layer and will return an error message.

# Challenge question
##################################
# Scatter plots can be useful exploratory tools for small datasets. 
# For data sets with large numbers of observations, such as the surveys 
# data set, overplotting of points can be a limitation of scatter plots. 
# We have already seen how we can visualise data better when we have 
# overplotting with the geom_smooth plot. Another way for handling 
# overplotting is to display the density of the data through contours. 
# As this challengeâ€™s task create a script called plot_density2d.R which 
# loads the file data/portal_data_joined.csv into the variable surveys. 
# It then uses this dataset to plot the weight on the x-axis and hindfoot_length on the y-axis in a geom_density2d plot.

# Pipes
#####################

# challenge
#Challenge 1 - pipes
#Subset the surveys_complete data to keep only the species_id, weight, hindfoot_length, year and sex columns and the animals collected on and after 1995. Then plot a scatter plot of weight (x-axis) against hindfoot_length (y-axis) using this transformed dataset. Do all the above using pipes, without creating any variables.
#Answer 
surveys_complete %>%
  #select columns
  select(species_id, weight, hindfoot_length, year, sex) %>%
  #filter rows
  filter(year >= 1995) %>%
  #plot transformed data
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point()


#Challenge 2 - plotting subset with different colour
#Plot all the animals in the surveys_complete dataset as weight (x-axis) against hindfoot_length (y-axis). Use the dataset created above which contains only the animals that were collected on and after 1995 and highlight these points in red in the plot.

#Answer 
survey_recent <- surveys_complete %>%
  select(species_id, weight, hindfoot_length, year, sex) %>%
  filter(year >= 1995)

ggplot(mapping=aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length)) +
